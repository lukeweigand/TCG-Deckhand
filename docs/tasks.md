## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Battle System Design (Oct 30, 2025):** Implemented battle as a multi-phase process (BLOCKER â†’ COUNTER â†’ RESOLVE) matching One Piece TCG. Each phase can be executed separately for interactive gameplay, or combined with `execute_full_battle()` for testing/AI. Power modifications are tracked as a list of (source, modifier) tuples for transparency.
- **Action Pattern (Oct 30, 2025):** All game actions inherit from base `Action` class with `action_type` enum. Each action is a dataclass containing all parameters needed to execute it. Actions are validated separately from execution, enabling AI to query legal moves without side effects.
- **Game State Management (Oct 29, 2025):** Implemented authentic One Piece TCG board layout with all official zones: Leader area (center top), Character area (max 5 cards), Stage area, Hand, Deck, Trash, and DON!! system (don_deck, don_pool, active_don, attached_don). Each zone serves a specific purpose in gameplay.
- **Phase System (Oct 29, 2025):** Implemented turn phases as enums (REFRESH â†’ DRAW â†’ DON â†’ MAIN â†’ END) with automatic phase advancement and turn wrapping. The END phase automatically switches to the opponent's REFRESH phase.
- **Dataclass Architecture (Oct 28, 2025):** Using Python dataclasses for Card, Deck, PlayerState, and GameState models provides clean serialization (to_dict/to_json) and immutable defaults while keeping code readable.
- **Repository Pattern (Oct 28, 2025):** Database operations separated into card_operations.py and deck_operations.py provides clean separation of concerns and makes testing easier.

### One Piece TCG Rules Clarifications
- **Battle Resolution (Oct 30, 2025):** Attack succeeds if attacker power >= defender power. Defense succeeds if defender power > attacker power. This asymmetry means equal power favors the attacker (matching official One Piece TCG rules).
- **Blocker Mechanics (Oct 30, 2025):** Only one blocker per attack. Blocker must be ACTIVE to block. When blocking, blocker becomes RESTED and becomes the new target. Defender can then play counters on top of blocker usage (blocker â†’ counter â†’ resolve order).
- **Counter Cards (Oct 30, 2025):** Counter events can only be played during battle (counter phase). After use, they go to trash. Effects vary by card ("+2000 to character", "-3000 to opponent", etc.). Multiple counters can be played on a single battle.
- **DON!! Power Bonuses (Oct 30, 2025):** DON!! attached to characters/leaders only provide +1000 power during YOUR turn, not opponent's turn. This is crucial for battle calculations - defender's attached DON!! don't help when being attacked.
- **Win Condition - Leader Defeat (Oct 29, 2025):** A player does NOT lose when their life reaches 0. They can continue playing at 0 life. They only lose when they take damage WHILE at 0 life (the "final blow"). This is tracked with a `defeated` flag on PlayerState.
- **DON!! System (Oct 29, 2025):** Each player has 10 DON!! cards. DON!! can be attached to cards for +1000 power per DON!!. DON!! is managed through don_deck (10 cards), don_pool (total accumulated), active_don (available this turn), and attached_don (per-card bonuses).
- **Life Cards (Oct 29, 2025):** Life cards are the top X cards from the deck (where X = leader's life value), placed face-down under the leader at game start. When the leader takes damage, life cards are removed.

### Learning Moments
- **Clarifying Requirements First (Oct 30, 2025):** Before implementing Phase 2.3, asked detailed questions about One Piece TCG battle mechanics (blocker order, counter timing, DON!! refresh, summoning sickness, trigger effects). This prevented implementing wrong assumptions. Lesson: When dealing with complex domain rules, validate understanding BEFORE coding.
- **Living Documentation Discipline (Oct 30, 2025):** Forgot to update tasks.md while implementing Phase 2.3 code. Got called out by Luke for not maintaining the living document. Lesson: Update documentation AS YOU GO, not after the fact. Make it part of the workflow, not an afterthought.
- **Test Fixtures Matter (Oct 29, 2025):** Initial tests failed because fixtures created players with empty decks/life, triggering immediate game-over. Fixed by initializing fixtures with valid game state. Lesson: Test fixtures should represent realistic scenarios.
- **Mentorship Approach:** Building incrementally with tests after each feature provides confidence and catches bugs early. This "implement â†’ test â†’ verify" cycle is now standard workflow.

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Monte Carlo Tree Search AI implementation
- Multiple TCG rule sets (PokÃ©mon, Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh)
- Deck import from popular formats
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Deck archetype detection
- Multiplayer support (far future)
